## Installing Git

````
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install git
````

##Adding your private key
If you are connecting to Git repo's then you'll need a private key on your server. 

````
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa | ssh andyjarrett@example.com 'cat >> .ssh/id_rsa'
````

YOU SHOULD GUARD THIS KEY with your life, so make sure you change the permission to 600 so other users on the system won't have access to it. N.B. the following command is **not** run with **sudo** as this is **your** file.

````
chmod 600 id_rsa
````
