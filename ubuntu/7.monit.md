##Installing MONIT
####Now we're going to monitor the services

We're going to use Monit on Ubuntu which is simple to get up and running 


	$ sudo apt-get install monit


Now letâ€™s configure Monit to check its reading custom config files. Open


	sudo nano /etc/monit/monitrc


Scroll to the bottom and you should see `/etc/monit/conf.d/*` as uncommented. If it isn't there, add it, or if it is commented out then uncomment it.


Important: Change permission on the folder /etc/monit/conf.d you might want it to hold your email password and this will be stored in plain text.

	sudo chmod a-rwx,u=rwX -R /etc/monit/conf.d/

I'm going to store all the monitoring configuration in one file, though you could easily break this up in to seperate files i.e. ````/etc/monit/conf.d/lucee.conf````, ````/etc/monit/conf.d/nodejs.conf````, and ````/etc/monit/conf.d/nginx.conf````  etc 

Lets add the details to the Config file. Create/open

````sudo nano /etc/monit/conf.d/all.conf````

Add the following:

````
#enable the built in web server for browsing the services you're monitoring:
set httpd port 2812 and
    use address localhost
    allow localhost

set mailserver email-smtp.XXXXXX.amazonaws.com port 465
    username "SMTP USER" password "SMTP PASSWORD"
    using sslv3 with timeout 15 seconds using hostname mytag.io
set mail-format {
    from: alerts@example.com
    subject: $SERVICE $EVENT at $DATE on $HOST
    message: Alert from $HOST
Date: $DATE
For $SERVICE ($EVENT) and take $ACTION
---------------------------------------
$DESCRIPTION
}

set alert alerts@example.com


check process railo_ctl with pidfile /opt/railo/tomcat/work/tomcat.pid
    start program = "/etc/init.d/railo_ctl start" with timeout 90 seconds 
    stop program = "/etc/init.d/railo_ctl forcequit"
    if failed host 127.0.0.1 port 8888 with protocol http and request "/railo-context/admin/server.cfm" with timeout 5 seconds for 3 times within 4 cycles then restart

check process apache2 with pidfile /var/run/apache2.pid
    group www
    start program = "/etc/init.d/apache2 start"
    stop program = "/etc/init.d/apache2 stop"
    if children > 250 then restart
    if loadavg(5min) greater than 10 for 8 cycles then stop
    if 3 restarts within 5 cycles then timeout
    
check process nginx with pidfile /var/run/nginx.pid
    start program = "/etc/init.d/nginx start"
    stop program  = "/etc/init.d/nginx stop"    

# check against RAM and RAM + SWAP.
check system Memory
        alert root@localhost on { resource } with reminder on 10 cycles
        group resources
        if memory usage > 80% for 5 cycles then alert
                else if passed within 5 cycles then alert
        if loadavg (15min) is greater than 0.95 for 2 cycles then alert
                else if passed within 5 cycles then alert
    
````

Once that is saved you need to reload Monit

````sudo monit reload````

#### Now if you want to check it works you'll need to kill a service i.e.

```` sudo killall apache2 ````
