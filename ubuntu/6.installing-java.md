## Installing Java and Tomcat7

````
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:webupd8team/java 
sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer
````

Now set your `JAVA_HOME` variable so it's there after a reboot

```
sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-set-default
```
You will then need to logout and login back again, since the specific command creates two files under /etc/profile.d, named jdk.sh and jdk.csh which populate the environment with JAVA_HOME etc.


You can check if Tomcat is running with ````sudo service tomcat7 status```` But I prefer to check all the  services with the following command

````sudo service --status-all````

You should see **[ + ]  tomcat7** in the list. If its **[ - ]  tomcat7** then something has gone wrong. Try to start it up ````sudo service tomcat7 start```` to see what the problem is. The only issue i've had is with Tomcat not starting up becuase it cannot find $JAVA_HOME, if so you can add the following line ````JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle```` to the file **/etc/default/tomcat7**
