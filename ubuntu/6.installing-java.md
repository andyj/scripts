## Installing Java

````
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:webupd8team/java 
sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer
````

Now set your `JAVA_HOME` variable so it's there after a reboot

````
sudo nano /etc/environment
````

Copy the following to the new file, depending on how old this guid is you might want to double check the path by running ````ls /usr/lib/jvm/````

````
PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/bin:/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/db/bin:/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle$
JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle
DERBY_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/db
````

Those paths will only be recognized after you logout or restart, so if you want to use them right away run `source /etc/environment`

It shouldn't be needed at this point but if you want to have a sanity check that all is ok run ````sudo reboot```` and when you can SSH back in try ````echo $JAVA_HOME```` to check the paths.

You can check if Tomcat is running with ````sudo service tomcat7 status```` But I prefer to check all the  services with the following command

````sudo service --status-all````

You should see **[ + ]  tomcat7** in the list. If its **[ - ]  tomcat7** then something has gone wrong. Try to start it up ````sudo service tomcat7 start```` to see what the problem is. The only issue i've had is with Tomcat not starting up becuase it cannot find $JAVA_HOME, if so you can add the following line ````JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle```` to the file **/etc/default/tomcat7**
