##Installing Node.js
####Lets get the basics installed:

````
$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install build-essential && sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
````

We're going to install Node via a Node Version Manager (NVM) - the below URL is probably out of date, check out [https://github.com/creationix/nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to get the latest version.

````
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.31.1/install.sh | bash
````
Once installed NVM you will need to refresh your terminal.

````
$ source ~/.profile
````

Now we're going to install the latest stable version of Node

````
$ nvm install stable
````

You can go off an create a small Node app and test it here. Next we are installing PM2

````
$ sudo apt-get update
$ npm install pm2
$ pm2 startup #PM2 can generates startup scripts and configure them in order to keep your process list intact accross expected or unexpected machine restarts.
````

It will help you autocompleting commands, application name and related:
````pm2 completion install````
