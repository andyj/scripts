##Installing Nginx with HTTP/2

For some speed improvments we're going to add HTTP2 which was published as RFC 7540 in May 2015. This allows you to load multiple assets using a single connection for great speed improvments. To do this we are going to edit our Sources.list and add 2 line.

````
$ sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
````

Add the following two line

	deb http://nginx.org/packages/ubuntu/ trusty nginx
	deb-src http://nginx.org/packages/ubuntu/ trusty nginx


Once that is saved we'll need to get nginxâ€™s public key

````
$ curl http://nginx.org/keys/nginx_signing.key | sudo apt-key add -
````

````
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install nginx
````

Having it installed isn't enough thoughm, you'll need to enable it as well for your HTTPS connections (*this ONLY works on HTTPS connections*)

````
server {

	listen 443 http2;
	listen [::]:443 http2;

	[...]

}
````

Check your install ```` curl http://localhost```` or if this is an externally availabe site open up a browser windows and go to [http://Your.IP.Address](http://Your.IP.Address)
