## Installing Git

````
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install git
````

##Adding your private key
If you are connecting to Git repo's then you'll need a private key on your server. 

````cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa | ssh andyjarrett@example.com 'cat >> .ssh/id_rsa'````

YOU SHOULD GUARD THIS KEY with your life, so make sure you change the permission to 600 so other users on the system won't have access to it. N.B. the following command is **not** run with **sudo** as this is **your** file.

```` chmod 600 id_rsa ````





##Installing Node.js
####Lets get the basics installed:

````
$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install build-essential && sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
````

We're going to install Node via a Node Version Manager (NVM) - the below URL is probably out of date, check out [https://github.com/creationix/nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to get the latest version.

````
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.31.1/install.sh | bash
````
Once installed NVM you will need to refresh your terminal.

````
$ source ~/.profile
````

Now we're going to install the latest stable version of Node

````
$ nvm install stable
````

You can go off an create a small Node app and test it here. Next we are installing PM2

````
$ sudo apt-get update
$ npm install pm2
$ pm2 startup #PM2 can generates startup scripts and configure them in order to keep your process list intact accross expected or unexpected machine restarts.
````

It will help you autocompleting commands, application name and related:
````pm2 completion install````

##Installing Nginx with HTTP/2

For some speed improvments we're going to add HTTP2 which was published as RFC 7540 in May 2015. This allows you to load multiple assets using a single connection for great speed improvments. To do this we are going to edit our Sources.list and add 2 line.

````
$ sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
````

Add the following two line

	deb http://nginx.org/packages/ubuntu/ trusty nginx
	deb-src http://nginx.org/packages/ubuntu/ trusty nginx


Once that is saved we'll need to get nginxâ€™s public key

````
$ curl http://nginx.org/keys/nginx_signing.key | sudo apt-key add -
````

````
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install nginx
````

Having it installed isn't enough thoughm, you'll need to enable it as well for your HTTPS connections (*this ONLY works on HTTPS connections*)

````
server {

	listen 443 http2;
	listen [::]:443 http2;

	[...]

}
````

Check your install ```` curl http://localhost```` or if this is an externally availabe site open up a browser windows and go to [http://Your.IP.Address](http://Your.IP.Address)


###Creating your first site

If **/var/www** doesn't exist already then run ````mkdir /var/www```` then 

````
sudo chown -R "$USER":www-data /var/www/ &&
sudo mkdir /var/www/yourSite.com
````
Add the user to the www-data group (you only need to do this once per site setup)

````
sudo usermod -a -G www-data andyjarrett
````
Own the folder and set read/write permission

````
sudo chown -R andyjarrett:www-data /var/www/yourSite.com
sudo chmod -R 2770 /var/www/yourSite.com/

````

## Installing Java

````
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:webupd8team/java 
sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer
````

Now set your `JAVA_HOME` variable so it's there after a reboot

````
sudo nano /etc/environment
````

Copy the following to the new file, depending on how old this guid is you might want to double check the path by running ````ls /usr/lib/jvm/````

````
PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/bin:/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/db/bin:/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle$
JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle
DERBY_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/db
````

Those paths will only be recognized after you logout or restart, so if you want to use them right away run `source /etc/environment`

It shouldn't be needed at this point but if you want to have a sanity check that all is ok run ````sudo reboot```` and when you can SSH back in try ````echo $JAVA_HOME```` to check the paths.

You can check if Tomcat is running with ````sudo service tomcat7 status```` But I prefer to check all the  services with the following command

````sudo service --status-all````

You should see **[ + ]  tomcat7** in the list. If its **[ - ]  tomcat7** then something has gone wrong. Try to start it up ````sudo service tomcat7 start```` to see what the problem is. The only issue i've had is with Tomcat not starting up becuase it cannot find $JAVA_HOME, if so you can add the following line ````JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle```` to the file **/etc/default/tomcat7**
